The management makes a press statement that they have found a new CEO expected to steer the company to greater heights. They are confident that the newly appointed CEO will do good things for the company.","As we all know, Reliance is one the largest companies in the country, and regardless of whether there is news or not, market participants would like to buy or sell the company’s shares, and therefore the price moves constantly.","The second company is relatively unknown and, therefore, may not attract market participants’ attention as there is no news or event surrounding this company. Under such circumstances, the stock price may not move, or even if it does, it may be very marginal","To summarize, the price moves because of expectations of news and events. The news or events can be directly related to the company, industry, or the economy as a whole. For instance, the appointment of Narendra Modi as the Indian Prime Minister was perceived as positive news, and therefore the whole stock market moved."],

These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape, creating massive wealth for their shareholders.","The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in the growth or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short-term market sentiment, thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is stock tanking in the Covid crash of March 2020. Due to short-term negative sentiment, almost all the good stocks were beaten down significantly around March/April 2020, only to post a V-shaped recovery in the subsequent months.","A few successful investors are – Charlie Munger, Peter Lynch, Benjamin Graham, Thomas Rowe, Warren Buffett, John C Bogle, John Templeton, Mohnish Pabrai etc."],

A share certificate is nothing but a document entitling you as the owner of the shares in a company. Before 1996 the share certificate was in paper format; however, post-1996, the share certificates were converted to digital form. Converting a paper format share certificate into a digital format share certificate is called “Dematerialization,” often abbreviated as DEMAT.","Did you know the Harshad Mehta scam of 1992, played a significant role in digitizing the share certificate? I’d suggest you watch the SonyLiv series on the Harshad Mehta saga, it gives you a good perspective of the market’s ecosystem before it went digital.","The share certificate in DEMAT format has to be stored digitally. The storage place for the digital share certificate is the ‘DEMAT Account. A Depository is a financial intermediary that offers the Demat account service.  Think of the demat account as a digital vault for your shares. As you may have guessed, your broker’s trading account and the DEMAT account from the Depository are interlinked.","For example, if your idea is to buy Infosys shares, then all you need to do is open your trading account, look for Infosys’ prices, and buy it. Once the transaction is complete, the role of your trading account is done. After you buy, the shares of Infosys will automatically get credited to your demat account.","Likewise, when you wish to sell Infosys shares, you must log in to your trading account and sell the stock.

    info: ["The monetary policy is a tool through which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) controls the money supply by controlling the interest rates. RBI is India’s central bank. Likewise, every country’s central bank is responsible for setting interest rates. For example, the European Central Bank in Europe and Federal Reserves in the US. Central Banks tweak the interest rates to control the money supply in the mainstream economy.", "While setting the interest rates, the RBI has to strike a balance between growth and inflation. In a nutshell – if the interest rates are high, the borrowing rates are high (particularly for corporations). If corporate can’t borrow easily, they cannot grow. If corporations don’t grow, the economy slows down.","On the other hand, borrowing becomes easier when the interest rates are low. This translates to more money in the hands of corporations and consumers. With more money, there is increased spending which means the sellers tend to increase the prices of goods and services, leading to inflation.","Reverse repo rate – Reverse Repo rate is the rate at which RBI borrows money from banks. Or in other words, Reverse Repo is the deposit rate RBI offers to other banks when the banks park funds with RBI. When banks deposit money to RBI, they are certain that RBI will not default, so the rate RBI offers is relatively low. However, the banking system’s money supply reduces when banks deposit money with RBI (at a lower rate) instead of the corporate entity. An increase in the reverse repo rate is not great for the economy as it tightens the money supply. Sometimes via the central bank’s policy, the central bank mandates higher deposits by banks; again, this is a way to curtail excess money supply in the mainstream economy.","Cash reserve ratio (CRR) – Every bank must maintain funds with RBI. The amount that they maintain is dependent on the CRR. If CRR increases, more money is sucked out of the mainstream economy, which is not good for the economy.","The monetary policy committee members meet regularly to review the economic situation and decide upon these key rates; hence keeping track of the monetary policy event is a must for any active trader. The first to react to rate decisions would be interest-rate sensitive stocks across various sectors such as – banks, automobiles, housing finance, real estate, metals, etc."],

    info: ["Inflation is a sustained increase in the general prices of goods and services. Increasing inflation erodes the purchasing power of money. All things being equal, if the cost of 1 KG of onion has increased from Rs.15 to Rs.20, this price increase is attributed to inflation. Inflation is inevitable, but a high inflation rate is not desirable as it could lead to economic uneasiness. A high level of inflation tends to send a bad signal to markets. Both the Government and RBI work towards reducing inflation to a manageable level. Inflation is generally measured using an index. If the inflation index increases by certain percentage points, it indicates rising inflation. Likewise, an index falling indicates inflation cooling off.", "There are two inflation indices – The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI).","Wholesale Price Index (WPI) – The WPI indicates the movement in prices at the wholesale level. It captures the price change when goods are bought and sold wholesale. WPI is an easy and convenient method to calculate inflation. The inflation measured here is at an institutional level and does not necessarily capture the consumer’s inflation.","Consumer Price Index (CPI)– The CPI, on the other hand, captures the effect of the change in prices at a retail level. As a consumer, CPI inflation is what matters. The calculation of CPI is quite detailed as it involves classifying consumption into various categories and subcategories across urban and rural regions. Each of these categories is made into an index, the final CPI index is a composition of several internal indices. The CPI captures the effect of inflation on daily household consumables like fruits, vegetables, cereals, and even fuels like petrol and diesel.","The computation of CPI is quite rigorous and detailed. It is one of the most critical metrics for studying the economy.  A national statistical agency, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), publishes the CPI numbers around the 2nd week of every month. The RBI’s challenge is to strike a balance between inflation and interest rates. Usually, a low-interest rate tends to increase inflation, and a high-interest rate tends to arrest inflation."],

The data is released every month (along with inflation data) by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI). As the name suggests, the IIP measures the Indian industrial sectors’ production, keeping a fixed reference point. As of today, India uses the reference point of 2004-05. The reference point is also called the base year.", "Roughly about 15 different industries submit their production data to the ministry, which collates the data and releases it as an index number. If the IIP increases, it indicates a vibrant industrial environment (as the production is going up) and hence a positive sign for the economy and markets. A decreasing IIP indicates a sluggish production environment, hence a negative sign for the economy and markets.","To sum up, an upswing in industrial production is good for the economy, and a downswing rings an alarm. As India is getting more industrialized, the relative importance of the Index of Industrial Production is increasing.","A lower IIP number puts pressure on the RBI to lower the interest rates and aid industrial credit with cheaper credit."],

We will, in this chapter, help you figure this out in line with what most Assessing Officers (AOs) would be expecting. By income, I mean both profits and losses.","When trading or investing, you need to classify your income under one of the following heads are –","Long-term capital gain (LTCG)","Assume you buy stocks or Mutual Funds today for Rs.50,000/- and sell the same after 365 days at Rs.55,000/-, then the profit or gain of Rs.5,000/- is considered as a long-term capital gain. Generally speaking, gain or profit earned by investing in stocks or equity mutual funds and selling after 1 year from the date of purchase can be categorized under LTCG. Before the Union Budget announced in July 2024, in India, any gains realized and categorized as LTCG (equity & equity MF) were completely exempt from taxes for the first Rs 1lk and attracted a 10% LTCG tax if the gains for the year exceeded Rs 1lk. Do note that the purchase and sale of shares have to be conducted via a recognized exchange, meaning you should have paid STT.","From FY 2024-25 onwards, the Union Budegt increased the exemption of Rs 1 Lacs to Rs 1.25 Lacs, and long-term gains exceeding Rs 1,25,000 will be taxed as follows:","If the sale occurred before July 23rd, 2024, the tax rate is 10%","If the sale occurs after July 23rd, 2024, the tax rate is 12.5%","The above tax rates shall not apply if the investment and the consequent sale were made via an off-market transaction and not via a recognized stock exchange.

If you sell those shares today for Rs. 20,00,000 today, your tax liability will be based on Rs. 15,00,000 (Rs. 20 lks – Rs. 5 lks), and not on Rs. 19,00,000 (Rs. 20 lks – Rs. 1 lk). If, however, the value of these shares on 31st January 2018 was less than your purchase price of 1,00,000, then you may consider your actual purchase cost for computing the LTCG tax applicable to you."],

For example, brokerage charges, STT, other statutory taxes while trading, internet, phone, newspapers, depreciation of computers and electronics, research reports, books, advisory, etc.","Offset the loss with gains – If one incurs any non-speculative F&O trading loss, this can be set off against any income other than salary. For example, if I incur a Rs 5,00,000 loss in trading F&O and my other income (like rent & interest, excluding salary) is Rs 10,00,000, I will have to pay tax only on Rs 5,00,000.","Carry forward the F&O loss – If there is a net loss any year (non-speculative F&O + any income other than salary), and if income tax returns are filed before the due date, the loss can be carried forward for the next 8 years. During the next 8 years, this loss can be set off against any other business gain (non-speculative business income). For example, if you had a net loss of Rs 5,00,000 this year trading F&O, which was declared on time, you can carry forward this loss next year, and assuming you made a profit of Rs 20,00,000 next year, you can set off the previous year’s Rs 5,00,000 loss and pay taxes only on Rs 15,00,000."],

  info:["The rule is very clear with respect to F&O trading and intraday equity trading. F&O trading has to be considered as a non-speculative business, and intraday equity as a speculative business. So, if you trade these instruments, you have to use ITR 3 to file IT returns. So even if you are salaried, you have to compulsorily use ITR3 and declare this income (profit or loss) from trading as a business.","Unlike what most people think, losses are also recommended to be declared. Hiding trading activity on the exchange from the IT department could mean trouble, especially in case of any IT scrutiny (IT scrutiny is when the assessing income tax officer (AO) demands you to meet him and give an explanation on your IT returns). The chances of getting a call for scrutiny are higher when the IT department systems/algorithms pick up trading activity on your PAN, but the same is not declared on your ITR.","For equity delivery-based investments, if you are holding stocks for more than a year, you would have received some kind of dividend, and even if you didn’t, you can show them all as investments and claim an exemption under the long-term capital gain. If you are buying and selling stocks frequently (yes, it is an open statement, but there is no rule that quantifies ‘frequent’) for shorter terms, it is best to declare that as non-speculative business income instead of STCG.","Another thing to keep in mind is that if investing/trading in the markets is your only source of income, and even if your trading activity is moderate, it is best to classify income from all your equity trades as business income instead of capital gains. On the other hand, if you are salaried or have some other business as your primary source of business, it becomes easier to show your equity trades as capital gains, even if the frequency is slightly higher.","Thankfully, you can be a trader and investor both at the same time. So, you can have stocks meant as an investment for the long term, and stocks meant for shorter-term trades. Just because you indulge in a lot of shorter-term trades wouldn’t necessarily convert all your long-term holdings or investments into trades and, therefore, bring those long-term gains under business income.

For example, if you are earning over Rs.15,00,000/- per year in salary, you will fall in the 30% slab, and hence STCG will also be taxed at 30%. Also, STCG is applicable only when the income exceeds a minimum tax slab of Rs 2.5lks/year if you have opted for the old regime and a minimum tax slab of Rs. 3lks/year if you have opted for the new regime.

  info:["STT (Securities Transaction Tax) is a tax payable to the government of India on trades executed on recognized stock exchanges. The tax is not applicable to off-market transactions which are when shares are transferred from one DEMAT to another through delivery instruction slips instead of routing the trades via exchange. But off-market transactions attract higher capital gains tax as explained previously. The current rate of STT for equity delivery based trades is 0.1% of the trade value.","When calculating taxes on capital gains, STT can’t be added to the cost of acquisition or sale of shares/stocks/equity. Whereas brokerage and all other charges (which include exchange charges, SEBI charges, stamp duty, service tax) that you pay when buying/selling shares on the exchange can be added to the cost of share, hence indirectly taking benefit of these expenses that you incur.","Advance tax when you have realized capital gains (STCG)","Every taxpayer with business income or with realized (profit booked) short term capital gains is required to pay advance tax on 15th June, 15th Sept, 15th December, and 15th March. Advance tax is paid keeping in mind an approximate income and taxes that you would have to pay on your business and capital gain income by the end of the year. You as an individual are required to pay 15% of the expected annual tax that you are likely to pay for that financial year by 15th June, 45% by 15th Sept, 75% by 15th Dec, and 100% by 15th March. Not paying would entail a penalty of annualized interest of around 12% for the period by which it was delayed.","When you are investing in the stock markets, it is very tough to extrapolate the capital gain (STCG) or profit that will be earned by selling shares for an entire year just based on STCG earned for a small period of time. So if you have sold shares and are sitting on profits (STCG), it is best to pay advance tax only on that profit which is booked until now. Even if you eventually end up making a profit for the entire year which is lesser than for what you had paid advance tax, you can claim for a tax refund.

In the US, if stocks are sold and bought back within 30 days just to reduce taxes on realized gains, they are called wash sales, and taxes are disallowed to be offset.

Meaning, the value of Rs.100 today is not really Rs.100, 2 years from now. Inversely, the value of Rs.100, 2 years from now is not really Rs.100 as of today. Whenever there is the passage of time, there is an element of opportunity. Money has to be accounted (adjusted) for that opportunity.","If we have to evaluate, what would be the value of money that we have today sometime in the future, then we need to move the ‘money today’ through the future. This is called the “Future Value (FV)” of the money.  Likewise, if we have to evaluate the value of money that we are expected to receive in the future in today’s terms, then we have to move the future money back to today’s terms. This is called the “Present Value (PV)” of money.",],

I hope you are your family are staying safe. Please double mask if you really have to step out. I hope humanity does not have to face this situation ever again, and we get out of this situation as quickly as possible.","Let me start this module on Financial Modelling with an apology. I know this module was due for a while now. I know, I’ve taken a lot of time to get started on this. There were multiple reasons for the delay, but that’s all behind now. Here we are, all set. I’m super excited to deliver this module, and I hope you are excited as well ","Financial modelling as a subject is taught either in the classroom or in a  video format. There is a reason for this – while teaching this subject, at any given point, we tend to open up multiple threads and then tie it all together in the end. So in a sense, there are hops, jumps, crisscrossing, and a bit of number juggling. Given the nature of this subject, it makes sense to teach this online or via a physical classroom setup.","Think of it as producing a movie. I’m sure you understand that a movie is not shot scene after scene in a sequential manner. Different scenes are shot, songs are recorded, action scenes are shot, edited, and then patched together and eventually made to look like the entire movie was show scene after scene."],

  info: ["Perhaps an essential question – what is ‘Integrated Financial Modelling’, and why do we need to learn this?","Think about a typical company; as you can imagine, the company can have several moving parts. For example, a manufacturing company can have a team procuring raw materials, workforce to manufacture goods, admin team, finance team, regulators, compliance, marketing, supply chain, distribution, R&D, and whatnot.","Given the enormity, how do you break a company down into smaller parts and gain meaningful insights into its functioning?  How do we gauge its efficiency?","Well, this is where financial modelling comes into play. Eventually, whatever the company does, it all boils down to numbers and metrics.","For example, successful operations lead to revenue generation, successful cost management leads to operating profits. Good financial practice leads to manageable debt levels; good supply chain management leads to better inventory management. Good dividend policy strikes a balance between a company’s growth and shareholder value. So on and so forth.","So the approach we take here is that if we can systematically analyze the numbers presented in the financial statements, perhaps it opens up a window to understand the company better.","When I talk about understanding financial statements, I’m talking about getting into granular details; we go line by line. Many often assume that a series of simple financial ratio analysis results in great insights into the company. Yes, to some extent, it does, but we can do a lot more to better understand the company.","The end objective of any financial model is to help you build a perspective of valuation. The final output of the financial models is the company’s share price after factoring in everything that matters. You take the share price from the model, compare the share price against the market share price, and figure if the stock is fairly valued, undervalued, or overvalued."],

I foresee myself stressing on this several times throughout this module, so bear with me.  A typical Financial model will have multiple excel sheets within a single workbook. We need to ensure our Excel workbook is appropriately indexed and formatted and the format stays consistent across the entire model.","For example, if I’m dealing with 2018 data in column ‘E’ of my excel sheet, I’ll ensure that column E across all the other sheets will always deal with 2018 data. Or here is another example of the layout, column A and B will be shrunk to ensure easy indexation across all the sheets.","At this point, this may come across as a bunch of vague statements, but you will appreciate these points as we progress along.","Historical Data – A rather painful task, but this need to be done. We need to download the Annual report of the company we are dealing with, preferably for the last five years.

The approach is ok as long as you intend to build a simple financial model.","However, at times, taking efforts to build a dedicated revenue model of a company pays off.  With a dedicated revenue model, you can identify the key revenue drivers and get some granular insights into the behaviour of these revenue drivers.","In this chapter, I’d like to discuss the approach you need to take while building a company’s revenue model. As you can imagine, the revenue model sits within the integrated financial model, just like the assumption sheet.","A sensible way to start building a revenue model is by asking common sense questions about the company. In most cases, these questions themselves segways into a template for the revenue model. We will take the same approach to build Bajaj Auto’s revenue model.","So here are a bunch of common-sense questions, and the answers to these questions will help us build the revenue model.

As I have stressed earlier, the steps that I follow make sense to me; if you feel there is a better way, you should explore. Remember, there is no prescribed methods to build a model.","Here are few other things that you can do with the revenue model –","We have the total bike and CV sales data. Compare this with the production data. Ensure the company is not selling more than what it is making. If yes, then our model may be wrong and needs some tweaking","If the vehicles sold are close to manufactured, the company may have to invest in a CAPEX cycle.

Finally, in the end, everything comes together and falls into one gigantic vessel for the final dish to take shape.","Next is the calculation of Profit before tax (PBT), which is essentially the difference between the total income and the total expenses. After calculating the Profit before tax, we need to calculate the tax amount. The tax amount calculation is a very tricky job, and one would need the auditor’s help to arrive at the exact value. Since we must continue the model, we will depend on the averages.","The transfer to the general reserves is based on the PAT.

After we do, hopefully, the balance sheet balances. Notice, I used the words ‘derive the cashflow statement’. What do I mean by that? You need to take a few steps back and think about the cash flow statement and its purpose.","The cash flow statement of a company gives the company’s cash position. The cash position itself is estimated after reviewing the cash inflow and outflow from the company’s operations, investments, and financing activities. Each of these activities either generates cash or consumes cash.","Think about the high-level summary of cash flow and how the company’s CFO and their team prepare the statement. Like the P&L and Balance Sheet, the cash flow is also prepared by considering the voucher entries, bills, receipts, and bank reconciled statements. Preparing the cash flow statement with bank reconciled statements, invoices, and receipts is called the ‘Direct cashflow method.’","There is a third approach to cash flow. It is called the ‘indirect method’ of cash flow preparation. In the indirect method, we take the P&L and the Balance sheet data of the company as input and process the input based on a series of logical steps. The result of the process is the company’s net cash flow. Here is the good part – the net cash flow derived from the process should match the company’s cash flow stated in the balance sheet. If it does, then it kind of validates the model for us. If the numbers don’t match, then it is because we’d have made an error somewhere in the model, and it allows us to recheck. For this reason, we will use the indirect method of preparing the cash flow statement.","Think about it this way; our main focus is to build the structure of a house with a solid foundation. Once the house is built with the proper foundation, we can mix and match the interiors as many times until we find it to our satisfaction. Extending the same thought, our objective is first to build the model with the right linkages. Once the model is fully built and completely integrated, we will spend time debating each assumption, figuring out if it makes sense, and changing the values accordingly."],

The company needs to invest in plants, machinery, and equipment to carry out the operations. To finance the operations, it may (or may not) needs funds from external sources. If the company borrows money, they have to repay. Then, of course, from the profits, dividends are distributed.","Each of these categories either generates cash or consumes cash. For example, consider the inventories of a company. The inventory of a company is directly related to the company’s operations. If the company’s inventory has increased compared to the previous year, then it means that more money is stuck in terms of finished goods. Hence, inventory (which is an operational activity) has consumed cash. On the other hand, if the inventory is less in year two than in year one, inventory has generated cash or conserved cash.","Let us take another example. Assume that a company has borrowed money from the bank to fund operations. Borrowing funds is a financing activity, and by borrowing, cash is credited to the company’s bank account, hence considered as generated cash.","Likewise, when paying dividends (financing activity),  money goes out of the company’s account; hence, it is treated as an activity that consumes cash."],

We start with the PAT, add back depreciation, and then add the net change in working capital by considering each line separately.","I want you to notice two things here. First, I’m starting the sheet by directly working on the Year 2 data. There is a reason for this, which you will soon realize. Second, I’ve extracted the depreciation value from the balance sheet and not the P&L, and this is because the P&L depreciation is only for the year, but in the balance sheet, you not only get the yearly depreciation but the depreciation non-expense as well.

Traders describe this as one of the dream bull runs in the United Sates. Dow made an all-time high of 2,722 during August 1987. This was roughly a 44% return over 1986.   However, around the same time, there were again signs of a stagnating economy. In economic parlance, this is referred to as ‘soft landing’ of the economy, where the economy kind of takes a breather. Post-August 1987’s peak, the market started to take a breather. The months of Aug, Sept, Oct 1987, saw an unprecedented amount of mixed emotions.

Financial regulators were even more concerned about system wide shocks and firm’s capability to assess risk.  Financial firms were evaluating the probability of a ‘firm-wide survival’ if things of such catastrophic magnitude were to shake up the financial system once again. After all, the theory suggested that ‘October 1987’ had a very slim chance to occur, but it did.","It is very typical for financial firms to take up speculative trading positions across geographies, across varied counterparties, across varied assets and structured assets. Naturally, assessing risk at such level gets nothing short of a nightmarish task. However, this was exactly what the business required. They needed to know how much they would stand to lose, if October 1987 were to repeat. The new breed of traders and risk mangers calling themselves ‘Quants’, developed highly sophisticated mathematical models to monitor positions and evaluate risk level on a real-time basis. These folks came in with doctorates from different backgrounds – statisticians, physicist, mathematicians, and of course traditional finance. Firms officially recognized ‘Risk management’ as an important layer in the system, and risk management teams were inducted in the ‘middle office’ segment, across the banks and trading firms on Wall Street. They were all working towards the common cause of assessing risk.","Then CEO of JP Morgan Mr.Dennis Weatherstone, commissioned the famous ‘4:15 PM’ report. A one-page report which gave him a good sense of the combined risk at the firm-wide level. This report was expected at his desk every day 4:15 PM, just 15 minutes past market close. The report became so popular (and essential) that JP Morgan published the methodology and started providing the necessary underlying parameters to other banks.

After all, in most of these situations, the price difference between what we perceived as right and the one available in the markets would be marginal – few Rupees probably, but then our minds just do not permit us to go ahead."],

  title:"Functional Fixedness",
  info:["This is yet another cognitive biases – although you will not read much about this particular bias in the trading world. However, I think it kind of has its impact on traders, especially the ones who trade derivatives.","There is juice shop near my office which I frequent for a glass of fresh juice. On one of those visits, I asked for my regular orange juice, but the guy at the juice shop was busy fixing the mixer jar. The handle of the jar was loose and had to be fixed. The guy was busy trying to find a screwdriver to tighten the mixer’s handle. Unable to find one, he was kind of clueless on how to proceed.","This is functional fixedness at its best. Functional Fixedness is a cognitive bias that limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used. We assign tasks to objects and we live with that rigidity all our lives. For example – we have all grown up with the notion that we only need to look for a screwdriver to tighten screws, without which one cannot. However, a simple spoon can do the same job! One has to start thinking out of the box to solve problems in unconventional ways."],

  title:"Module Orientation",  
  info:["I agree that each of these topics is vast, and commands an entire module on its own. However, these assets are not as liquid as equities. We are still at a very nascent stage when it comes to trading these alternate assets in India. Given this, the idea here would introduce these assets, familiarize you with what drives these assets, and what you need to watch out for before placing your trades. So, in a sense, you could consider this module as a ‘thought-starter’ of sorts for trading these alternative assets. Needless to say, we will try and discuss these topics to a reasonable depth, ensuring you have more than just the bare basics on these topics.","We’ll begin the module by discussing Currencies. We’ll discuss some of the popular currency pairs traded in India such as USD-INR, GBP-INR, and INR-JPY. We also discuss other (non INR) currency pairs such as EUR-USD, GBP-USD, and USD-JPY. The discussion on currencies would be spread across a few chapters. The objective here would be to introduce these currency pairs and familiarize with not just the contract specification but also with a few fundamental factors that affect these currencies.","Once this is done, we’ll move on to the next part of the module. This deal with Commodities. We’ll follow a similar template here – i.e. introduce the commodities (both agri and non-Agri) and get familiarize you with not just the contract specifications but also a few fundamental factors which would influence the movement of these commodities. Some of the commodities we’ll be discussing would be – Gold, Silver, Zinc, Aluminum, Crude oil, Natural Gas, Turmeric, Cardamom, Pepper, Cotton, etc. Of course, the formula to calculate the price of commodities such as Gold, based on the price of Gold in International markets will also be discussed.","Lastly, this module will discuss ‘Interest Rate Futures (IFR)’, which I think is an inspiring space. The discussion would deal with topics related to RBI’s borrowing pattern, issuance of sovereign bonds, listing on NSE, and eventually trading them. Based on how we progress, we can even touch topics related to bond trading and bond trading strategies."],

  title:" Currency (in)equality",  
  info:["– The Barter era","Before the advent of currencies, transactions occurred through something called the ‘barter system’. A barter system is a ‘method of exchange’ which has existed for many centuries. In a typical barter, people exchange goods for other goods (or services). A classic example would be – say a farmer has harvested cotton, he could exchange (or barter) cotton with another farmer giving him wheat. Similarly, a farmer who has oranges could exchange the oranges he has harvested with someone who agrees to wash his cows and sheep.","The problem with the barter system was the scale and divisibility of the system. For example assume a farmer had 5 bales of cotton and he wants to barter cotton with someone selling cattle, assuming 2 bales for 1 cow, after the barter he’d be left with 2 cows and a bale of cotton. He would certainly not get half a cow for 1 bale of cotton. This caused a divisibility issue within the system."," Goods for the Metal era","The problems that plagued the barter system eventually paved the way to the next transaction methodology. People tried to invent a common denominator for the ‘exchange’. The common denominator ranged from food grains to metals. But eventually, metals thrived for obvious reasons. The metal was divisible, easily movable, and metal had no issue with shelf life. Further, of all the metals, Gold and Silver were the most popular; therefore, eventually, these metals became the standard for transactions. The direct exchange between gold/silver and goods lasted for many centuries; however, things started to change when people deposited gold and silver coins in safe havens and issued a ‘paper’ against the value of gold. This paper derived its value based on the gold/silver coins deposited in haven.","The Gold Standard era","Over time, as domestic trade flourished, trading across borders also flourished. Economic sense prevailed, and merchants realized producing everything locally did not make sense. Merchants started exploring cross border trade – simple import and export of goods thrived. This also meant merchants transacting across the border also required to pay for it in a currency that was acceptable across borders. Banking systems also evolved, and somewhere around the late 19th Century exchanging goods for Gold (not silver) became the norm. Valuing the local currency against the value of gold was called the ‘Gold Standard’."],

  title:" International Currency market (Forex)",  
  info:["Internationally, the national currency trading volume is massive and needs a moment to digest the figure. As per the April 2013 survey conducted by ‘Bank of International Settlement’ (BIS) the size of International Markets stands at $5.4 Trillion! Here is the link for the detailed report. My guess is we could be close to $5.8 – 6 Trillion as of April 2016. If you can imagine, this is roughly 20% higher than the entire Indian annual GDP that gets traded daily!","To understand what I mean, keep the Indian markets as a reference and think about it. Before Indian markets are open, the Australian, Japanese, Hong Kong, and Singapore markets are open. In fact, we get some overlap with these markets. While the Southeast market closes, Indian markets would have just warmed up with Middle Eastern markets opening up. This leads to the European markets opening up – London, Frankfurt, and Paris being the financial nerve centre of Europe. In fact, Indian markets are situated in a sweet spot as our time zone overlaps with major Southeast Asian markets and the European markets. Finally, the US markets open, followed by the Japanese markets, and the cycle continues 24 hours a day, 6 days a week!","Unlike Equity markets, participation in Forex is not just restricted to investors and traders. The participants in the Foreign Exchange (Forex) markets are many – Central Banks, Corporate, Banks, Travelers, and of course, traders. Each of these participants has their own agenda while participating in the Forex markets. For example, the corporate may be buying/selling USD to hedge their order book, and a traveller maybe buying USD for his travel expense. At the same time, the trader may be just speculating on the movement of the currency.  Obviously, since participation comes in from many quarters, the volumes are driven up. More so, Forex trading is highly leveraged, hence the notional value appears large."],

  title:" Dual View",  
  info:["Think about a stock, Infosys for example, when you buy or sell Infosys – your view on the stock is straightforward – you are either bullish or bearish on Infosys. Therefore, you buy or sell Infosys. Now think about a currency pair – say USD INR, when you buy or sell USD INR, whether you know or not, you have a dual view on the pair. For instance, when you buy USD INR; it implies you are bullish on the US Dollar and bearish on the Indian currency.","Base Currency / Quotation Currency = Value","In other words, if the value of the pair goes up, then the power of the Base currency goes up while at the same time, the quotation currency weakens. This translates to you being bullish on the Base currency and bearish on the quotation currency at the same time.","Similarly, if you sell the USD INR pair, it implies that you anticipate the Base Currency to buy a lesser amount of quotation currency. This translates to you being bearish on base currency and bullish on the quotation currency."],

  title:" Events that matter",  
  info:["Think about an event that can potentially change the sentiment on a stock. Quarterly result of the company is one such event. Estimating the change in sentiment based on this event is quite straightforward. If the quarterly result is good, the sentiment is positive; therefore, the stock price is expected to go up. Alternatively, if the quarterly result is not great, the sentiment is hurt, and therefore the stock price is expected to go down. The point here is, there is some linearity between the event and the expected outcome.","However, when it comes to currency pairs, there is no such linearity, which makes it a herculean task to assess the impact of events, a.k.a. fundamentals on currencies. The complexity mainly stems from the fact that currencies are quoted as pairs. While some factors lead to the strengthening of a pair, an event could occur at the same time that weakens the pair.","Let me give you an example to illustrate this – imagine two economic events running in parallel. Event 1 –   India receives a continuous inflow of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) geared towards long term investments. Clearly, this is a big positive for the economy, and therefore it tends to strengthen the INR. Event 2 – There is an uptick in the US economy (or a fear of a crash in commodities) leading to an appreciation in the US Dollar.","Given these two events occur in parallel – which direction will the USD INR currency pair move? Well, the answer to this is not straightforward. Eventually, the currency pair will take cues from the more dominant of the two factors and head in that direction, but until this happens, the pair invariably exhibits volatile behaviour. Hence, to successfully trade currencies, it becomes essential to track world events and assess their impact on the currency pair in question."],

MCX is particularly popular for the Metals and Energy commodities while NCDEX for all the agri commodities. However, there is a lot of activity picking up on MCX for agri commodities as well. My job over the next few chapters is to discuss these commodities which are traded on the exchanges and get you familiar with the commodity contracts.","We will look into every commodity that is actively traded on the commodity exchanges. The idea is to know how the commodity contract works (contract specification), figure out which contract to trade and identify the factor which influences the commodity. I will skip the usual background to commodities market part, the one which talks about the history, forwards markets, the farmers in the US, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange etc. You will find this in almost any material on the Commodity market.

  info:["Gold is a very actively traded contract in MCX. It has ample liquidity, with daily trades of roughly 15,000 contracts translating to a Rupee value of over 4500 Crore. Note, these numbers belong to just one type of Gold contract, often nicknamed “Big Gold”.","Gold comes in quite a few variants that one can choose to trade-in. Newbie and sometimes even the experienced commodity traders often get confused with these contracts, not knowing which one to trade and the difference between them. To begin with, let me list down all the different types of Gold contracts –","Gold (The Big Gold)","Gold Mini","Gold Guinea","Gold Petal","Do recall, settlement in equities is always in cash and not physical. However, when it comes to commodities, the settlement is physical and therefore ‘delivery’ is compulsory. This means if you hold 10 lots of gold and you opt for delivery, then you will get 10 kg of gold. To get the delivery of the commodity, one has to express his intention to do so. This has to be done any time before 4 days to expiry. So given that the expiry is on 5th, one has to express his intent to take delivery anytime on or before the 4th (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).","For all practical purposes, if you know these things about the Gold contract, you pretty much know what is really required before you trade the big Gold contract."],

  info:["Beyond the Gold Mini contract, we have Gold Guinea and Gold Petal contract. These are extremely tiny contracts which demand a shallow margin, as low as Rs.1251 (Gold Guinea) and Rs.154 (Gold Petal). The lot size is small, and therefore the contract value is small as well. You will find a few variants like Gold Petal (Delhi), Gold Guinea (Ahmadabad) etc., and I would suggest you ignore these, especially if your idea is to trade Gold.","Here is my honest opinion – if you are trading Gold stick to either the Big Gold contract or the Gold Mini contract, simply because the liquidity is quite bad in all the other contracts. To give you a perspective on liquidity on a regular trading day (on MCX) –","The number of lots in Gold Petal should not entice you to believe that the liquidity is high, do remember Gold Petal lot size is just 8 grams, and therefore 8-9K lots translates to roughly 2-2.5 Crs.","Another important thing to note – liquidity is highest in the nearest month contract, so always stick to these. The thumb rule here is – farther the contract expiry, lower is the liquidity."],

  title:" The London fix",
  info:["In the previous chapter, we discussed the various Gold contracts that are available on MCX. I want to begin this chapter by discussing how the prices of Gold in the spot market are arrived at internationally and in India.  However, I have to mention this – this method to ‘fix’ gold prices is merely symbolic and holds very little relevance to trading gold futures at MCX. I’m discussing this simply because it is an interesting thing to know. J","Internationally, the price of Gold is fixed in London daily, twice a day in two different sessions. The morning session at 10:30 AM is referred to as ‘AM Fix’ and the evening session at 3:00 PM is called the ‘PM Fix’. The prices are fixed by the gold dealers from London’s biggest bullion desk. The whole process is facilitated by Nathan Mayer Rothschild & Sons.","There are about 10-11 participating banks, which include names like JP Morgan, Standard Chartered, ScotiaMocatta (Scotiabank), Société Générale etc.  Do note, the general public and other banks are not permitted to participate in this process. The dealers from these banks call the dedicated conference line at the designated time and submit their bids to buy and sell gold. From all the bids and offers an average price is arrived at, and the same price is relayed to the market, which then becomes the benchmark for gold trading. The whole process lasts for about 10-15 minutes. The process is again repeated in the ‘PM session’, and the gold prices are again discovered and relayed to the markets.","The gold price that is fixed by the AM and PM sessions is very close to the actual price of gold that is traded in London and other international markets. So in a sense, the price that is relayed holds no surprise to traders or bullion dealers, in fact, some participants even believe that like many things in England, even this is conducted more to keep up with tradition.","india too follows a somewhat similiar practice,but less elaborate. India, being one of the biggest consumers of Gold, imports the yellow metal."],

  title:"Gold price disparity",
  info:["Traders tend to compare the Gold futures rate in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Gold Futures rate on MCX and assume there is an arbitrage opportunity lurking around. The rationale for this is that Gold being an international commodity should often trade at around the same price, in the absence of which an arbitrage opportunity arises. So for example, if 10 grams of 995 purity Gold in CME is quoted at $430, then on MCX the price of 10 grams of 995 purity should be in and around $ 430.","There was a clear run-up in Gold before the event and post the event, in fact, the big candle that you see during this period is on 24th June, the day after the Brexit verdict was out. Naturally, gold rallied owing to the outcome of Brexit. In fact, every time there is any global/domestic uncertainty, investors flock to buy gold. This is mainly driven by the fact that Gold is considered a haven, capable of preserving your wealth.","Almost all the major events in the past have had an impact on Gold, think about it – Oil crisis, middle eastern uprising, Israel-Palestine, EU migrant crisis, Greek economy, Euro crisis, Lehman Brothers; the list is never-ending. But the point to note is that every world event impacts the prices of gold.","Take a look at the chart above, in 1970 Gold was at roughly $35 and today in 2016, Gold is at $1360, translating to a 37x return. However, when you look at it from a CARG perspective, this translates to about 8% year on year growth. The world average inflation is roughly between 5-6%. This means if you are an investor in gold, on the one hand, you are expected to make 8%, and on the other, you lose about 6% (owing to inflation) netting you with an outperformance of 2%. However, in countries such as India where inflation is high, investment in Gold does not really fetch much."],

  info:["One of the key attributes of TA is that TA can be applied to any asset class, including currencies and commodities. Let me develop some trading notes on Gold by employing TA. Hopefully, this will give you a sense of how to apply TA on Gold.","The very first thing that I do when developing a trading view is to look at the long term chart of the asset; by long term, I mean at least 2 years. I’ll do the same here; I’ll look at the end of day Gold Bees (ETF) chart for this. Do note, and I will use this chart to develop a rough idea on the primary trend of Gold and also observe critical price points if any.","With all this, I can conclude that I’d be more comfortable with long trades than short, but this does not mean that I will not short Gold. I would if the risk to reward is enticing enough. However, if I short Gold, I will always be aware that traders out there are looking for opportunities to buy gold at every dip; hence I will be quick to cover my short position. I was hoping you could do note, until this stage, I have only developed a broad-based view on Gold and have not ventured into any specific price levels.","I would now be interested in looking at a short term chart of Gold, in identifying trading opportunities if any. Please have a look at the chart below, before we get into identifying trading opportunities (for which we will have to look at the right side of the chart), let’s spend a little time on the left side of the chart.","Well, remember Gold contracts are introduced almost a year in advance, for example, the Oct 2016 contract (which we are looking at), would have been introduced around Oct 2015. However, this contract does not attract any liquidity till it nears its actual expiry, i.e. October 2016. If on the other hand, our markets were very vibrant with lots of liquidity, then probably this contract would have attracted liquidity much earlier.s"],
